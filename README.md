# Snagick Collector
## About
This is a backend for a server that collects cards from a copy of MTG that we play in scout called Snagicky.
For a long time we had just bunch of Excel documents that hold the whole thing barely to gather, consistent naming convention out of the winow and non-functioning search (Just the names). 
And that's not mentioning that this is "old" (started at 2007) board game, meaning many these excel "databases" have been lost to time.
## Database
Database has main 6 table that are connected by another and additional 3 to connect them
